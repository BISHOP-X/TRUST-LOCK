Build an interactive 3D globe component using React Three.js that visually represents real-time login locations for cybersecurity analysis.

The globe should have:

A realistic Earth texture with visible continents (no grid, no longitude or latitude lines).

A slightly glowing atmosphere effect to give it a modern cyber-tech aesthetic.

Pins or markers above key login locations (use coordinates to plot points). Each pin should:

Gently pulse or glow to show active logins.

Include a hover tooltip showing location, time, and device used.

Travel lines connecting locations:

Blue lines for normal travel (e.g., user logs in from the same region).

Red animated curved lines for “impossible travel” events (e.g., logins from two far-apart places within an unrealistic time).

Animate the line drawing over time for a dynamic visual effect.

Add smooth rotation and drag controls for interactivity.

Background: dark blue to black gradient, matching TrustLock’s theme colors (#0B1221 and #F8C729).

Include subtle ambient lighting and a soft glow around the globe for visual depth.

The overall vibe should match cybersecurity visuals — modern, sleek, and analytical — while staying minimal and performance-optimized.
